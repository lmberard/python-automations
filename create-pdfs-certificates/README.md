# Create PDFs with Reportlab and Python!
Tired of creating a lot of pdfs with the same information only to change one parameter? 
With this file you can create n numbers of pdf certificates with a specific design using data from excel in seconds :)

This uses `reportlab` library for Python which creates a canvas to "draw" your document and creates a pdf file with that. 

## Ejecution
1. Install python
2. Install reportlab
  ```
  pip3 install pandas reportlab
  ```
4. Install openpyxl
  ```
  pip3 install openpyxl
  ```
4. To create all the pdfs in the `pdfs` folder run the code:
  ```
  python3 createPDFs.py
  ```
5. If you want to delete all the generated pdfs run:
  ```
  python3 deletePDFs.py
  ```

TODO: send each pdf to each email after creating them
